# Case-of-Solving-Partial-Differential-Equation-in-Chemical-Engineering

This study modeled a solid-liquid reactive extraction process for simulating the extraction of oleoresin compounds from ginger. The modeling yielded concentration profiles as functions of radial position and time, which were then formulated into partial differential equations (PDEs). In this particular case, I employed the finite difference approximation (FDA) method as the primary approach, along with the solve_ivp function from SciPy, to solve the PDE system.
